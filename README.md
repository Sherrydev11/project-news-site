# News Site

This project/assignment was to create a News Site to practise grid and flexbox. I created a Sports News Site and made it responsive so that it looks well structured on desktop, tablet and mobile.

## The problem
It was challenging with the mediaquery that took time because of expermenting with the min and max width.
